Programming Skills:
1. Creating + Managing Python Package with __init__.py 
2. Git Ignore files 
3. Creating Dashboards
4. App Development (maybe in Java)

ML Skills:
1. Forward Pass  (pass input through model)
2. Backpropegation (retrieve gradients using chain rule principals)
3. Gradient Descent ()

4. Create animation using 3blue1brown. Have it take one instance feed through network (showing output of each layer). Then backpropegate + update weights (show error maybe). Display loss going down and accuracy going up: Find inspiration here: https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-backpropagation-algorithm-7bb3aa2f95fd


Milestones / Mini Projects:
1. Create Weight Tunning Application to tune simple neural network to fit or divide data 
2. AutoEncoder + Decoder (intermediate)
3. "Image Creator" / predict the next pixel based on some starting point (pro)
4.
